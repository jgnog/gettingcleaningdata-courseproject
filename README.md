# gettingcleaningdata-courseproject
This is the final course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

Files in this repo:

- run_analysis.R    This contains the script that will load and tidy the dataset and also perform summary operations.
- CodeBook.md       Contains information on the variables, the data and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
- README.md         This file contains general information on this project.

The script should be run from its directory and the data should be in a
subdirectory called data.

The script does not need any input. It will load the data automatically and
output a clean dataset according to the instructions. Please read CodeBook for
more detail.
