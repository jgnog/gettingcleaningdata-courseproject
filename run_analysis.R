# Load all the data

# Load the list of features in the feature vector

# Load the activity labels

# For the train and test datasets, load the feature vector, the labels
# and the subjects.
# The inertial signals will not be needed


# Merge the test and train datasets

# For the train and test datasets, construct a dataframe with the following
# columns:
#
# subject
# activity
# feature vector (one feature per column)

# Merge the two dataframes previously created by appending the rows of one
# to another.

# Use the list of features to properly name the dataframe's columns

# Subset the dataframe to retain only the columns that contain means
# or standard deviations

# Use the activity labels to substitute the integers in the activity
# column of the dataframe for descriptive activity labels

# Group the dataframe by subject and by activity

# Summarize the grouped dataset by computing the mean of each of the
# features
